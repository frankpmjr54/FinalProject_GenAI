# FinalProject_GenAI
This is the files for my Final Project, this is an LLM powered Startup Business Assistant.  It was conceived by me, but GenAI was used along the way in the SDLC process.  From determining requirements to a UML Class Diagram and even creating code.  This allowed me to go from inception to something that is releaseable in less then a month.  There were challenges along the way and sometimes iterative prompts to refind past work is not always the best outcome.  However, it is undeniable that using an LLM to help create software is definitely faster and less prone to false starts.  This coupled with an Agile methodology would enable engineers to produce better software, at a much quicker pace.
